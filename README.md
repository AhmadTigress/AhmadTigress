# Ahmad El-Rufai

I am `Ahmad El-Rufai`, a **medical student**. Passionate about **Artificial Intelligence**, computational radiology, and psychiatry.  
My goal is to harnesses the potential of AI in the practice of medicine while keeping patients' comfort and satisfaction at maximum priority.

I love to meet new people of different perspectives and perceptions because it is my practical class of human psychology.  
Besides that, I enjoy listening to Chinese flute, singing, and reading poems. Most times when coding gets daunting, I go for cycling.  
`Cartoons and horror movies` are my favourite! No matter how busy I am, I always find time for them.

I am currently working on Convolutional Neural Networks and Large Language Modeling. Those are the areas I intend to specialize in.  
I look forward to collaborating on any Data Science project.
